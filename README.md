# Optical Tweezer Trace Analysis (Kuo et al. Nature Communications 2022)

Deposit matlab code for the analysis of optical tweezer trace.
The matlab script takes input of a raw optical tweezer trace (a raw exmaple trace file is included) and the calibration data file.
The optical tweezer trace contains an ealier oscillation phase with smaller amplitue used to determine the anchor point position based on the parity (see Wang et al. 1997 Biophys J.).
The script output a force-extension curve with the worm-like chain model fit of DNA.
